# Welcome to Community Central!

Community Central is the popular video series on the world of open source, particularly projects sponsored by Red Hat.  We also cover topics from the world of open source project management.

Some sessions have public Q&A, and others are public videos with no Q&A.  You can [subscribe to our Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RedHatCommunity) to get notified as new videos go up.
