# Community Swag and the Cool Stuff Store

Merchandise, including shirts and stickers, for many open source communities are now
available via the [Red Hat Cool Stuff Store](https://store.ecompanystore.com/redhat),
including [Quarkus](https://store.ecompanystore.com/redhat/Shop//#/catalog/Collections/1421-Quarkus)
and [CentOS](https://store.ecompanystore.com/redhat/Shop//#/catalog/Collections/987-CentOS).
More projects will be added over the next few weeks.

## Shipping Community Swag

The Cool Stuff Store aims to offer project accessories globally, as open source
is global and Red Hat is global.  However, due to COVID restrictions, customs
laws, and other obstacles, we cannot actually send gear to every country in the
world the way we would like to.

First, we use Fedex Express International for shipping, so we can only send
items to their list of [served countries](http://www.fedex.com/sz/contact/served-countries.html).

Additionally, as of September 2020, we cannot ship clothing items to the following countries
due to COVID and/or customs restrictions:

* Argentina
* India
* Israel
* Mexico
* Russia
* Ukraine

Please note that this list changes as laws and procedures and shipping
restrictions change worldwide.
