# Community Swag and the Cool Stuff Store

Merchandise, including shirts and stickers, for many open source communities are now
available via the Red Hat Cool Stuff Store.  More projects will be added over
the next few weeks.

## Shipping Community Swag

The Cool Stuff Store aims to offer project accessories globally, as open source
is global and Red Hat is global.  However, due to COVID restrictions, customs
laws, and other obstacles, we cannot actually send gear to every country in the
world the way we would like to.

As of September 2020, the current list of countries we can't ship clothing to is:

* Argentina
* India
* Israel
* Mexico
* Russia
* Ukraine

Please note that this list changes monthly as laws and procedures and shipping
restrictions change worldwide.
